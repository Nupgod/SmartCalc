# SmartCalc

## Overview

This GitHub project is a versatile calculator application capable of calculating various equations, including trigonometric functions. Additionally, it offers graphing capabilities and includes a built-in calculator for calculating loan payments. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and is implemented using the C++17 standard. Visualization is handled using the QT framework. The calculator model utilizes Polish notation for efficient parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions.
